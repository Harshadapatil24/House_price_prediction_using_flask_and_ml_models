🏠 House Price Prediction – Powered by Machine Learning & Flask! 🚀
I'm thrilled to share a project I recently completed: a House Price Prediction Web Application that leverages 13 machine learning models to estimate property values based on key real-estate metrics.
This web app is designed with a clean, user-friendly interface and allows users to: ✅ Input important features like:
 • Average Area Income
 • Average Area House Age
 • Average Area Number of Rooms
 • Average Area Number of Bedrooms
 • Area Population
✅ Select any of the 13 pre-trained models to generate predictions
 ✅ View a complete model evaluation table to compare performance metrics
💡 Built using:
Flask for the backend
Pickle (.pkl) for model loading and prediction
HTML/CSS with Bootstrap for front-end templates (index.html, model.html, etc.)
This project helped me strengthen my end-to-end skills — from training ML models to deploying them through a fully functional Flask web interface.
